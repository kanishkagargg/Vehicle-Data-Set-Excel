# Vehicle-Data-Set-Excel

This is a dataset from a company who deals in selling of second-hand cars. Features in this data set are - Car_Name, Year, Selling_Price,	Present_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission, Owner.

I haved Microsoft Excel to clean, visualize and analyze the data.

Cleaning involved: 
1	Name of the cars should start with capital letters. Hence made a new column for it.
2	Outlier - There is one scooty called Activa 3g which covered 5L kms , runs on petrol, is automatic and was from 2008. This is not possible for a scooty to cover this much of distance. I moved it to the end of the row so that I could avoid it in calculations and not removing that entry at all.
3	There is a name of a car called 800 and from 2003. This could be Alto 800.
4	Added two columns called kms bins (to convert categorical from continuous) and pp-sp which is present price - selling price.
